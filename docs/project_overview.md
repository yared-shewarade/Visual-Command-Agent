The Visual Command Agent project is a comprehensive AI infrastructure initiative designed to simulate an AI research environment similar to Microsoftâ€™s Research Technology Engineering (RTE) team. The goal is to build and optimize a vision-language model capable of interpreting visual inputs combined with natural language commands to perform classification tasks. This project covers end-to-end AI infrastructure components:

* Model design and training with PyTorch
* Performance profiling and GPU resource monitoring
* Automation scripts for environment setup and cloud job submission
* Integration with Azure Machine Learning for scalable execution

The project demonstrates core competencies in ML system performance tuning, distributed GPU workload management, and integration of AI workflows into production-grade pipelines.
